Hey there 👋🏽 — I’m **Janekia**, the heart and hands behind **Pinkkard Design**.  

Welcome to my little corner of the web where creativity meets purpose. Here, you’ll find a mix of web design insights, behind-the-scenes looks at my projects, branding tips for small businesses, and personal growth reflections from my journey as a designer and entrepreneur.  

I believe great design isn’t just about how something looks — it’s about how it *feels* and how it *works* for real people. My goal is to share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still learning!) in a way that helps others bring their ideas to life, build confidence in their craft, and maybe even get inspired to start their own creative projects.  

✨ Expect posts about:
- Building and customizing websites with modern tools  
- Branding and visual identity tips for small business owners  
- Design process walk-throughs and case studies  
- Creative motivation, balance, and lessons learned along the way  

Thanks for stopping by — grab a cup of coffee, explore, and let’s grow together 🌿
